# Introduction
The aim of this thesis was to develop a system responsible for the control of air quality with particular emphasis on the measurement of concentrations of volatile organic compounds [VOC](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-are-volatile-organic-compounds-vocs) and atmospheric particulate matter [PM](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics).
System also provide measurment of temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure. The data is available on the local server as measurment dashboard created in Grafana.
User can also receive notification about dangerour level of pollution via discord server
